00:13.347 --> 00:15.708
(BRITISH ACCENT)
Forget it. It's too risky.

00:15.787 --> 00:17.108
I'm through doing that shit.

00:17.187 --> 00:19.708
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.348
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

00:22.428 --> 00:23.483
I know that's what I always say.

00:23.507 --> 00:24.587
I'm always right, too.

00:24.668 --> 00:26.307
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

00:26.387 --> 00:28.162
Yeah, well, the days of
me forgetting are over,

00:28.186 --> 00:30.347
and the days
of me remembering
have just begun.

00:30.427 --> 00:31.522
You know when you
go on like this

00:31.546 --> 00:32.546
what you sound like?

00:32.586 --> 00:33.802
I sound like
a sensible fucking man,

00:33.826 --> 00:35.266
that's what I sound like.

00:35.347 --> 00:37.043
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack, quack.

00:37.067 --> 00:38.963
Yeah, well, take heart,
'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again,

00:38.987 --> 00:40.242
'cause... since I'm
never gonna do it again,

00:40.266 --> 00:41.522
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack

00:41.546 --> 00:42.603
about how I'm never
gonna do it again.

00:42.627 --> 00:43.865
After tonight.

00:43.946 --> 00:45.749
Correct. I got
all tonight to quack.

00:46.728 --> 00:48.088
Can I get anyone more coffee?

00:48.113 --> 00:49.433
HONEY BUNNY: Oh, yes.

00:51.386 --> 00:52.545
Thank you.

00:52.625 --> 00:53.905
You're welcome.

00:55.141 --> 00:56.581
I mean, the way it is now,

00:56.825 --> 00:59.313
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

00:59.705 --> 01:01.585
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

01:01.665 --> 01:03.001
Federal banks ain't
supposed to stop you

01:03.025 --> 01:04.505
in any way during a robbery.

01:04.585 --> 01:06.464
They're insured. Why
should they give a fuck?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.904
You don't even need
a gun in a federal bank.

01:08.984 --> 01:10.160
PUMPKIN: I heard
about this one bloke,

01:10.184 --> 01:12.305
he walks into a bank
with a portable phone.

01:12.385 --> 01:13.481
He gives the phone
to the teller,

01:13.505 --> 01:15.105
bloke on the other end
of the phone says,

01:15.145 --> 01:16.665
"We got this guy's little girl.

01:16.745 --> 01:18.761
"If you don't give him
all your money,
we're gonna kill her."

01:18.785 --> 01:20.464
Did it work?
PUMPKIN: Fucking way,
it works.

01:20.504 --> 01:21.640
That's what I'm talking about!

01:21.664 --> 01:24.144
Knucklehead walks into
a bank with a telephone.

01:24.224 --> 01:26.024
Not a pistol, not a shotgun,

01:26.104 --> 01:27.944
a fucking phone.
Cleans the place out.

01:28.024 --> 01:29.664
They don't even
lift a fucking finger.

01:29.744 --> 01:31.463
Did they hurt the little girl?

01:31.543 --> 01:32.679
I don't know.
There probably never was

01:32.703 --> 01:34.063
a little girl
in the first place.

01:34.144 --> 01:35.399
W-well, the point
of the story
isn't the little girl.

01:35.423 --> 01:36.463
The point of the story is,

01:36.543 --> 01:38.542
they robbed the bank
with a telephone.

01:38.622 --> 01:39.622
You want to rob banks?

01:39.702 --> 01:40.878
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

01:40.902 --> 01:42.262
I'm just illustrating if we did,

01:42.342 --> 01:43.479
it would be easier
than what we been doing.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.822
And no more liquor stores?

01:44.902 --> 01:47.503
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

01:47.583 --> 01:49.038
Besides, it ain't
the giggle it used to be.

01:49.062 --> 01:50.862
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.839
Vietnamese, Koreans,
they don't even speak
fucking English.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.199
You tell 'em,
"Empty out the register,"

01:54.223 --> 01:55.237
they don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

01:55.261 --> 01:56.821
They make it too personal.

01:56.902 --> 01:58.557
We keep on,
one of these gook fucker's
gonna make us kill him.

01:58.581 --> 02:00.462
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

02:00.541 --> 02:02.021 line:20%
I don't want to kill
anybody, either.

02:02.102 --> 02:03.598
But they'll probably
put us in a situation

02:03.622 --> 02:05.301
where it's us or them.

02:05.382 --> 02:07.261
And if it's not the gooks,

02:07.342 --> 02:09.517
it's these old fucking Jews
who've owned the store
for 15 fucking generations.

02:09.541 --> 02:12.141
You got Grandpa Irving
sitting behind the counter

02:12.222 --> 02:13.740
with a fucking magnum
in his hand.

02:13.820 --> 02:15.157
Try walking into
one of those places

02:15.181 --> 02:16.437
with nothing but a phone,
see how far that gets you.

02:16.461 --> 02:17.901
Fuck it. Forget it.
We're out of it.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.661
Yeah, well, what then?
Day jobs?

02:20.420 --> 02:21.501
Not in this life.

02:21.580 --> 02:22.580
What, then?

02:24.341 --> 02:26.540
<i>Garcon,</i>coffee!

02:26.621 --> 02:28.181
This place.

02:30.139 --> 02:31.419
WAITRESS:
<i>"Garcon"</i>means "boy."

02:36.500 --> 02:37.500
This place?

02:37.579 --> 02:39.019
A coffee shop?

02:39.100 --> 02:40.100
What's wrong with that?

02:41.900 --> 02:43.739
Nobody ever robs restaurants.

02:44.419 --> 02:45.460
Why not?

02:46.500 --> 02:49.858
Bars, liquor stores,
gas stations...

02:49.939 --> 02:52.339
You get your head blown off
sticking up one of them.

02:52.418 --> 02:54.179
Restaurants, on the other hand,

02:54.258 --> 02:55.779
you catch with their pants down.

02:55.858 --> 02:57.698
They're not expecting
to get robbed.

02:57.779 --> 02:59.099
Not as expecting, anyway.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.899
I bet you could
cut down on the hero factor

03:01.978 --> 03:02.978
in a place like this.

03:03.059 --> 03:04.059
PUMPKIN: Correct.

03:04.099 --> 03:05.298
Same as banks,

03:05.379 --> 03:07.058
these places are insured.

03:07.137 --> 03:09.618
Manager...
He don't give a fuck.

03:09.697 --> 03:10.754
He's just trying
to get you out the door

03:10.778 --> 03:12.338
before you start
plugging the diners.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.017
Waitresses?
Fucking forget it.

03:14.098 --> 03:16.137
No way they're taking
a bullet for the register.

03:16.218 --> 03:19.098
Busboys, some wetback
getting paid $1.50 an hour,

03:19.178 --> 03:21.938
really give a fuck you're
stealing from the owner?

03:22.017 --> 03:23.512
Customers sitting there
with food in their mouths,

03:23.536 --> 03:24.672
they don't know what's going on.

03:24.696 --> 03:26.153
One minute they're
having a Denver omelette,

03:26.177 --> 03:28.217
next minute someone's sticking
a gun in their face.

03:29.057 --> 03:31.576
See, I got the idea

03:31.657 --> 03:33.696
last liquor store
we stuck up. Remember?

03:33.777 --> 03:35.337
All the customers
kept coming in?

03:35.416 --> 03:36.736
Yeah.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.377
You got the idea
taking their wallets.

03:38.457 --> 03:39.457
HONEY BUNNY: Mmm-hmm.

03:39.497 --> 03:40.537
Now, that was a good idea.

03:40.576 --> 03:41.936
Thank you.

03:42.015 --> 03:43.352
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

03:43.376 --> 03:44.535
HONEY BUNNY:
Yes, we did.

03:44.616 --> 03:46.096
A lot of people
come to restaurants.

03:46.176 --> 03:47.735
A lot of wallets.

03:47.815 --> 03:49.695
Pretty smart, huh?

03:50.496 --> 03:51.815
Pretty smart.

03:53.815 --> 03:56.015
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

03:56.096 --> 03:57.336
Come on.

03:57.415 --> 03:59.095
All right.

03:59.175 --> 04:00.414

I love you, Honey Bunny.

04:12.854 --> 04:14.614
Everybody, be cool,
this is a robbery!

04:14.695 --> 04:17.774
Any of you fucking pricks move,

04:17.853 --> 04:18.894

Okay. What you want to know?

06:37.166 --> 06:38.567

Yeah, it's legal,
but it ain't 100% legal.

06:39.965 --> 06:42.246

Yeah, it breaks down
like this, okay?

06:50.405 --> 06:52.485
It's legal to buy it,
it's legal to own it,

06:52.566 --> 06:54.766
and if you're the
proprietor of a hash bar,

06:54.845 --> 06:56.086
it's legal to sell it.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.364
It's legal to carry it,

No, man, they got
the metric system there.

07:40.763 --> 07:42.419

fuck a quarter-pounder is.

07:42.443 --> 07:43.643
What do they call it?

07:43.722 --> 07:46.243

go into Burger King.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.281
How many up there?

08:20.360 --> 08:21.600
Three or four.

08:21.681 --> 08:23.521
That's counting our guy?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.281
I'm not sure.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.639
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

08:27.719 --> 08:29.400
It's possible.

Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

I don't know.
However people meet people.

Oh, really? She do
anything I'd have seen?

08:43.599 --> 08:46.199
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

08:46.279 --> 08:47.718
Pilot? What's a pilot?

08:47.799 --> 08:49.919
Well, you know the shows on TV?

08:49.998 --> 08:51.279
I don't watch TV.

08:51.358 --> 08:52.799
Yeah, but you are aware

08:52.878 --> 08:54.799
that there's an invention
called television,

08:54.878 --> 08:57.079
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

08:57.159 --> 08:58.159
Yeah.

08:58.199 --> 08:59.599
Well, the way they
pick TV shows is,

08:59.679 --> 09:00.679
they make one show.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.357
That show's called a pilot.

09:02.438 --> 09:03.678
Then they show that one show

09:03.757 --> 09:04.853
to the people who pick shows,

09:04.877 --> 09:05.973
and on the strength
of that one show,

09:05.997 --> 09:07.837
they decide if they
want to make more shows.

09:07.918 --> 09:10.357
Some get chosen and become
television programs.

09:10.438 --> 09:13.117
Some don't, become nothing.

09:13.198 --> 09:14.333
She starred in one of the ones

09:14.357 --> 09:15.477
that became nothing.

09:19.797 --> 09:21.956
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

09:22.037 --> 09:23.517
Yeah, maybe.
Fat, right?

09:23.596 --> 09:25.413
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

09:25.437 --> 09:26.692
I mean, he got a weight problem.

09:26.716 --> 09:28.092

gonna do? He's Samoan.

09:28.116 --> 09:29.413
Yeah, I think
I know who you mean.

09:29.437 --> 09:30.437
What about him?

09:30.517 --> 09:32.157
Well, Marsellus
fucked him up good.

09:32.236 --> 09:33.797
Word around the campfire is,

09:33.876 --> 09:36.277

No, no, no, no, no.

09:48.235 --> 09:49.755
Well, then, what, then?

09:49.835 --> 09:51.875
Gave her a foot massage.

09:57.035 --> 09:58.114
Mmm-hmm.

09:58.195 --> 10:00.315
Then what did Marsellus do?

10:00.395 --> 10:01.955
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

10:01.994 --> 10:03.234
They took him out on his patio,

10:03.315 --> 10:04.675
threw his ass over the balcony.

10:04.754 --> 10:06.795
Nigger fell four stories.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.915
They had a little garden
down at the bottom,

10:08.994 --> 10:10.874
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

10:10.954 --> 10:13.074
Nigger fell through that.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.514
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

to react the way he did,

34:59.190 --> 35:01.590
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

35:02.831 --> 35:04.311
HI, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

35:08.950 --> 35:10.549
Let's see.
Steak, steak, steak.

35:10.629 --> 35:13.629
Oh, yeah,
the Douglas Sirk steak.

35:13.709 --> 35:14.750
I'll have that.

35:14.830 --> 35:15.950
How do you want that cooked?

35:16.029 --> 35:17.509
Burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

35:17.589 --> 35:19.430
Bloody as hell,
and oh, yeah, look at this.

35:19.509 --> 35:20.509
Vanilla Coke.

35:22.470 --> 35:24.589
What about you, Peggy Sue?

35:24.669 --> 35:29.508
I'll have
the Durward Kirby burger,

35:29.588 --> 35:30.749
bloody,

35:31.628 --> 35:33.028
and...

35:33.789 --> 35:35.389
The $5.00 shake.

35:35.469 --> 35:37.845
How do you want that shake?
Martin and Lewis,
or Amos and Andy?

35:37.869 --> 35:39.789
Martin and Lewis.

35:39.869 --> 35:41.829
Did you just order
a $5.00 shake?

35:42.469 --> 35:43.908
Mmm-hmm.

35:43.988 --> 35:46.388
That's a shake.
That's milk and ice cream.

35:47.027 --> 35:48.227
MIA: Last I heard.

35:48.308 --> 35:49.547
That's $5.00?

35:49.627 --> 35:51.348
You don't put bourbon
in it or nothin'?

35:51.428 --> 35:52.667
No.

35:52.748 --> 35:53.948
Just checkin'.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.828
BUDDY: I'll be right back
with your drinks.

35:55.908 --> 35:57.587
RICKY NELSON:
<i>â™ª ...lonesome town â™ª</i>

35:57.667 --> 36:02.026
<i>â™ª To cry my troubles away... â™ª</i>

36:03.907 --> 36:05.467
Could you, um...

36:05.546 --> 36:07.546
roll me one of those, cowboy?

36:08.666 --> 36:10.307
You can have this one, cowgirl.

36:11.066 --> 36:12.747
Thanks.

36:12.827 --> 36:15.626
<i>â™ª ...with regret â™ª</i>

36:16.626 --> 36:18.426
Think nothin' of it.

36:18.505 --> 36:20.866

36:22.585 --> 36:25.025
<i>â™ª I can learn to forget â™ª</i>

36:25.105 --> 36:26.585
MIA: So...

36:26.665 --> 36:28.946
Marsellus said you just
got back from Amsterdam.

36:29.025 --> 36:30.225
Sure did.

36:30.306 --> 36:32.065
MIA: How long
were you there?

36:32.145 --> 36:34.505
(SNIFFS)
Just over three years.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.664
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

36:40.265 --> 36:41.664
No kiddin'?

36:41.745 --> 36:43.305
I didn't know that.

36:44.425 --> 36:46.224
Why would you?

36:50.544 --> 36:52.544
I heard you did a pilot.

36:53.864 --> 36:55.824
That was my 15 minutes.

36:55.904 --> 36:57.344
What was it?

36:57.424 --> 37:00.143
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents

37:00.223 --> 37:01.904
called<i> Fox Force Five.</i>

37:01.984 --> 37:02.984
What?

37:03.023 --> 37:04.583
<i>Fox Force Five.</i>

37:04.663 --> 37:06.904
Fox, as in we're
a bunch of foxy chicks.

37:06.984 --> 37:09.464
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

37:09.543 --> 37:12.622
And five, as in there's
one, two, three, four,
five of us.

37:12.702 --> 37:14.502
There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.

37:14.582 --> 37:15.743
She was the leader.

37:15.823 --> 37:18.542
The Japanese fox
was a kung-fu master.

37:18.622 --> 37:21.743
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

37:22.702 --> 37:25.463
French fox's specialty was sex.

37:25.542 --> 37:27.062
What was your specialty?

37:27.142 --> 37:29.701
Knives.

37:29.782 --> 37:32.621
Character I played,
Raven McCoy,
her background was

37:32.701 --> 37:35.621
she grew up raised
by circus performers.

37:35.701 --> 37:37.021
According to the show,

37:37.101 --> 37:40.221
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife,

37:40.302 --> 37:42.422
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

37:42.501 --> 37:45.422
Her grandfather, an old
vaudevillian, taught her.

37:46.501 --> 37:48.421
And if we would've
got picked up,

37:48.500 --> 37:50.580
they would've worked in
a gimmick where every show,

37:50.660 --> 37:52.620
I would've told another joke.

37:55.421 --> 37:57.220
You know any of them old jokes?

37:57.301 --> 37:58.556
Well, I only got
the chance to say one,

37:58.580 --> 38:00.861
'cause we only did one show.

38:00.941 --> 38:02.060
Tell me.

38:02.140 --> 38:03.140
It's corny.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.139
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

38:06.219 --> 38:08.820
No. You wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

38:08.900 --> 38:10.260
VINCENT: You'd be em...

38:10.340 --> 38:13.740 line:20%
You told, like, 50 million
people, and you can't tell me?

38:13.820 --> 38:15.860
I promise I won't laugh.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.539
That's what I'm afraid of,
Vince.

38:17.619 --> 38:19.860
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.740
Well, now I'm definitely
not gonna tell you,

38:21.820 --> 38:23.179
'cause it's been
built up too much.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.819
What a gyp.

38:27.658 --> 38:29.138
BUDDY:
Martin and Lewis.

38:31.899 --> 38:33.379
Vanilla Coke.

38:38.618 --> 38:40.058
Mmm.

38:40.577 --> 38:42.177
Yummy.

38:42.258 --> 38:43.698
You think I could have
a sip of that?

38:47.057 --> 38:48.217
Be my guest.

38:48.298 --> 38:50.738
I gotta know what
a $5.00 shake tastes like.

38:52.217 --> 38:54.177
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

38:54.258 --> 38:55.537
Yeah, but maybe I do.

38:55.617 --> 38:56.858
Cooties, I can handle.

38:58.616 --> 39:00.297
All right.

39:07.377 --> 39:09.777
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake.

39:09.857 --> 39:11.496
Told you.

39:11.576 --> 39:14.176
I don't know
if it was worth $5.00, but
it was pretty fucking good.

39:47.295 --> 39:48.975
Don't you hate that?

39:49.534 --> 39:50.694
Hate what?

39:50.775 --> 39:52.894
Uncomfortable silences.

39:54.454 --> 39:55.814
Why do we feel it's necessary

39:55.894 --> 39:57.133
to yak about bullshit

39:57.213 --> 39:59.133
in order to be comfortable?

40:00.173 --> 40:03.934
I don't know,
but it's a good question.

40:04.013 --> 40:06.533
That's when you know
you've found somebody
really special...

40:07.774 --> 40:10.293
When you can just shut
the fuck up for a minute

40:10.373 --> 40:12.253
and comfortably share a silence.

40:12.333 --> 40:13.749
Well, I don't think
we're quite there yet,

40:13.773 --> 40:16.212
but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

40:17.532 --> 40:18.853
I'll tell you what.

40:20.973 --> 40:22.253
I'm going to go to the bathroom

40:22.333 --> 40:23.893
and powder my nose.

40:23.973 --> 40:26.973
You sit here and think
of something to say.

40:28.051 --> 40:30.051
I'll do that.

40:33.252 --> 40:34.252
Okay.

40:47.050 --> 40:48.251
(MEN WHISTLING)

40:55.570 --> 40:57.451
(MIA INHALING)

40:58.411 --> 40:59.931
I said goddamn!

41:00.371 --> 41:02.291
Goddamn.

41:02.371 --> 41:04.569
(WHISPERING) Goddamn.

(CAR DOOR SLAMS)

41:13.970 --> 41:15.049
Mmm.

41:16.049 --> 41:17.209
Don't you just love it

41:17.290 --> 41:18.545
when you come back
from the bathroom

41:18.569 --> 41:20.809
to find your food
waiting for you?

41:20.889 --> 41:22.729
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

41:22.809 --> 41:25.969
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

41:26.048 --> 41:27.825
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

41:27.849 --> 41:29.008
Would you like some coffee?

41:29.088 --> 41:30.144
Which one?
There's two Monroes.

41:30.168 --> 41:31.729
VINCENT: No, there's not.

41:31.809 --> 41:32.889
That is Marilyn Monroe.

41:35.168 --> 41:36.889
That is Mamie Van Doren.

41:38.088 --> 41:39.848
And I don't see Jayne Mansfield.

41:39.928 --> 41:41.687
She must have the night off,
or somethin'.

41:41.768 --> 41:43.127
Pretty smart.

41:43.207 --> 41:45.007
Yeah, I got my moments.

41:45.087 --> 41:46.768
So, did you think
of somethin' to say?

41:47.408 --> 41:48.647
Actually, I did.

41:50.687 --> 41:52.607
However...

41:55.368 --> 41:56.847
you seem like
a really nice person,

41:56.927 --> 41:58.486
and I... I don't
want to offend you.

41:58.566 --> 42:00.327
Ooh.

42:00.407 --> 42:02.767
This doesn't sound like
the usual mindless, boring,

42:02.847 --> 42:05.126
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

42:05.206 --> 42:07.526
This sounds like you actually
have somethin' to say.

42:07.606 --> 42:09.407
Well, well, I do. I do.

42:11.566 --> 42:13.566
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

42:13.646 --> 42:15.286
MIA: No! No, no, no.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.966
You can't promise
somethin' like that.

42:17.045 --> 42:18.966
I have no idea
what you're gonna ask me,

42:19.045 --> 42:20.902
so you can go ahead and ask
me what you're gonna ask me,

42:20.926 --> 42:23.645
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

42:23.726 --> 42:24.742
Then, through
no fault of my own,

42:24.766 --> 42:26.045
I would've broken my promise.

42:26.125 --> 42:27.685
Let's just forget it.

42:27.766 --> 42:29.205
That's an impossibility.

42:29.286 --> 42:31.126
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this

42:31.165 --> 42:32.604
would be an exercise
in futility.

42:32.684 --> 42:33.925
Is that a fact?

42:34.004 --> 42:37.004
Besides, isn't it more exciting

42:37.084 --> 42:38.261
when you don't have permission?

42:38.285 --> 42:39.725
All right. All right.

42:39.805 --> 42:42.365
Well, here it goes.

42:42.445 --> 42:45.365
What did you, uh, think about
what happened to Antwan?

42:45.445 --> 42:46.445
Who's Antwan?

42:46.524 --> 42:48.084
Tony Rocky Horror.
You know him.

42:48.845 --> 42:50.324
He fell out of a window.

42:50.404 --> 42:52.043
Mmm. Mmm.

42:52.123 --> 42:53.884
Well, that is one way to say it.

42:53.964 --> 42:56.643
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

42:56.724 --> 42:59.683
Another way would be was he
was thrown out by Marsellus,

42:59.764 --> 43:01.603
and yet even
another way is to say

43:01.683 --> 43:04.603
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

43:05.203 --> 43:06.563
Is that a fact?

43:06.643 --> 43:08.923
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

43:09.002 --> 43:10.122
It's just what I heard.

43:10.642 --> 43:11.723
Who told you?

43:11.803 --> 43:12.843
VINCENT: They.

43:14.042 --> 43:15.443
They talk a lot, don't they?

43:15.522 --> 43:17.323
(CHUCKLES)

43:17.403 --> 43:19.963
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

43:20.042 --> 43:21.923
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

43:22.002 --> 43:24.482
Well, I'm not...
I'm not shy. Um...

43:24.562 --> 43:26.762
Did it involve the "F" word?

43:26.842 --> 43:28.201
No. No, no, no.

43:28.282 --> 43:30.641
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

43:32.161 --> 43:33.282
And?

43:33.362 --> 43:35.802
And... And nothin'.
That's it.

43:38.121 --> 43:40.802
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror

43:40.882 --> 43:41.898
out of a four-story window

43:41.922 --> 43:43.441
for giving me a foot massage?

43:43.520 --> 43:44.520
VINCENT: Mmm-hmm.

43:44.600 --> 43:45.721
And you believe that?

43:45.801 --> 43:47.961
(CHUCKLES) Well, I mean,

43:48.040 --> 43:50.120
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

43:50.200 --> 43:53.441
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window

43:53.520 --> 43:55.520
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

43:55.600 --> 43:56.801
No, it seemed excessive,

43:56.881 --> 43:58.761
but that doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

43:58.841 --> 44:03.079
I mean, I understand
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

44:03.159 --> 44:06.599
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

44:06.679 --> 44:08.159
A husband almost
killing another man

44:08.240 --> 44:10.320
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

44:11.039 --> 44:12.360
But did it happen?

44:12.440 --> 44:14.039
Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine

44:14.119 --> 44:16.400
was my hand when he shook it...

44:16.479 --> 44:18.638
at my wedding.

44:18.719 --> 44:19.998
Really?

44:20.078 --> 44:22.078
Truth is, nobody
knows why Marsellus

straight to her heart, but
she's got a breastplate.

57:10.836 --> 57:12.196
You've got to
pierce through that.

57:12.276 --> 57:13.652

gotta bring the needle down

No! You don't gotta
fucking stab her three times.

You just gotta stab her once,

57:18.555 --> 57:19.716

breastplate into her heart.

This watch I got here

01:02:21.978 --> 01:02:24.258
was first purchased by
your great-grandfather

01:02:24.338 --> 01:02:26.537
during the First World War.

01:02:26.617 --> 01:02:28.577
It was bought in
a little general store

01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:30.818
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

01:02:30.898 --> 01:02:34.577
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

01:02:34.658 --> 01:02:37.017
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

01:02:37.097 --> 01:02:40.818
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge

01:02:40.898 --> 01:02:43.337
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

01:02:43.416 --> 01:02:45.576
This was your great-
grandfather's war watch,

01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:48.016
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

01:02:49.337 --> 01:02:50.432
And when he'd done his duty,

01:02:50.456 --> 01:02:52.616
he went home to
your great-grandmother,

01:02:52.697 --> 01:02:54.257
took the watch off,

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.536
put it in an old coffee can,

01:02:55.616 --> 01:02:57.416
and in that can it stayed

01:02:57.496 --> 01:02:59.776
till your granddad,
Dane Coolidge,

01:02:59.856 --> 01:03:01.216
was called upon by his country

01:03:01.296 --> 01:03:04.816
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

01:03:04.896 --> 01:03:06.856
This time they called it
World War Two.

01:03:08.376 --> 01:03:10.055
Your great-grandfather
gave this watch

01:03:10.135 --> 01:03:12.015
to your granddad for good luck.

01:03:13.336 --> 01:03:14.935
Unfortunately, Dane's luck

01:03:15.015 --> 01:03:16.376
wasn't as good as his old man's.

01:03:16.455 --> 01:03:18.655
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed

01:03:18.735 --> 01:03:20.215
along with all the other Marines

01:03:20.295 --> 01:03:21.735
at the Battle of Wake Island.

01:03:22.655 --> 01:03:24.494
Your granddad was facing death.

01:03:25.775 --> 01:03:27.534
He knew it.

01:03:27.614 --> 01:03:29.134
None of those boys
had any illusions

01:03:29.215 --> 01:03:31.974
about ever leaving
that island alive.

01:03:32.054 --> 01:03:34.734 line:20%
So, three days before the
Japanese took the island,

01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:37.734 line:20%
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport,

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.013 line:20%
name of Winocki,

01:03:40.093 --> 01:03:42.374 line:20%
a man he had never met
before in his life,

01:03:42.453 --> 01:03:44.533 line:20%
to deliver to his infant son,

01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:47.654 line:20%

in the flesh,

01:03:47.734 --> 01:03:50.013 line:20%
his gold watch.

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:51.973 line:20%
Three days later,
your granddad was dead,

01:03:52.053 --> 01:03:54.693 line:20%
but Winocki kept his word.

01:03:54.773 --> 01:03:56.052
After the war was over,

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:58.173
he paid a visit
to your grandmother,

01:03:58.253 --> 01:04:00.653
delivering to your infant father

01:04:00.733 --> 01:04:02.492
his dad's gold watch.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:03.773
This watch.

01:04:10.132 --> 01:04:12.292 line:20%
This watch was on
your daddy's wrist

01:04:12.372 --> 01:04:15.212 line:20%
when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

01:04:15.292 --> 01:04:18.531
He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.

01:04:18.611 --> 01:04:22.411
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:26.051
they'd confiscate it...
take it away.

01:04:26.131 --> 01:04:27.491
The way your dad looked at it,

01:04:27.571 --> 01:04:29.691
this watch was your birthright.

01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:30.891

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:32.450
gonna put their
greasy yellow hands

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.410
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:36.267
in one place he knew
he could hide somethin'...

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:37.331
His ass.

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:39.211
Five long years
he wore this watch

01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:40.610
up his ass.

01:04:40.691 --> 01:04:43.050
Then he died of dysentery,

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.891
he give me the watch.

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:46.449

hunk of metal

01:04:46.529 --> 01:04:48.449
up my ass, two years.

01:04:48.529 --> 01:04:51.690
Then... after seven years,

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.609
I was sent home
to my family. And...

01:04:54.489 --> 01:04:55.489
now...

like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood.

01:51:34.892 --> 01:51:36.269
Just take it to
a friendly place, that's all.

01:51:36.293 --> 01:51:37.652
This is the Valley, Vincent.

01:51:37.732 --> 01:51:39.187
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places.

01:51:39.211 --> 01:51:40.668
Well, Jules, this ain't
my fucking town, man!

01:51:40.692 --> 01:51:41.971
Shit!

01:51:42.051 --> 01:51:43.211
What you doing?

01:51:43.292 --> 01:51:44.508
I'm calling my partner
in Toluca Lake.

01:51:44.532 --> 01:51:45.811
Where's Toluca Lake?

01:51:45.891 --> 01:51:48.771
It's just
over the hill here,
over by Burbank studios.

01:51:48.851 --> 01:51:50.011 line:20%
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,

01:51:50.091 --> 01:51:51.508 line:20%
I don't know what the fuck
we going to do, man,

01:51:51.532 --> 01:51:54.171 line:20%
because I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

01:51:54.252 --> 01:51:56.611 line:20%
Jimmie, yo, how you
doing, man? It's Jules.

01:51:56.691 --> 01:51:58.010 line:20%
Just listen up, man.

01:51:58.090 --> 01:51:59.786 line:20%
Me and my homeboy
are in some serious
fucking shit, man.

01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:01.786
We're in a car, and we got
to get off the road pronto.

01:52:01.810 --> 01:52:03.731
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

01:52:05.291 --> 01:52:06.786
JULES: We got to be real
fucking delicate

01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:08.251
with this Jimmie
situation, you know.

01:52:08.331 --> 01:52:10.427
He's one remark away
from kicking our asses
out the door.

01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:11.707
VINCENT: If he does,
what do we do?

01:52:11.731 --> 01:52:14.169
Well, we ain't leaving
until we made a couple calls,

01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:15.745
but I don't want it
to reach that pitch.

01:52:15.769 --> 01:52:16.785
I mean, Jimmie's a friend.

01:52:16.809 --> 01:52:18.025
You don't come
into your friend's house

01:52:18.049 --> 01:52:19.410
and start telling him
what's what.

01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:21.769
Yeah, well, just tell him
not to be abusive, that's all.

01:52:21.849 --> 01:52:23.945
I mean, he kind of
freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

01:52:23.969 --> 01:52:25.266
Well, put yourself
in his position.

01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:26.466
I mean, it's 8:00
in the morning.

01:52:26.490 --> 01:52:28.809
He just woke up. He wasn't
expecting this shit.

01:52:28.889 --> 01:52:30.104
I mean, shit, we got
to remember here

01:52:30.128 --> 01:52:31.449
who's doing who a favor.

01:52:31.529 --> 01:52:33.425
Well, if that favor means
that I got to take a shit,

01:52:33.449 --> 01:52:34.729
then he can stick that favor

01:52:34.808 --> 01:52:36.329
straight up his ass.
I don't care.

01:52:36.409 --> 01:52:38.585
Hey, fuck, nigger.
What the fuck did you
just do to his towel, man?

01:52:38.609 --> 01:52:39.649
I was drying my hands.

01:52:39.729 --> 01:52:41.265
Well, you're supposed
to wash them first.

01:52:41.289 --> 01:52:43.425
Well, you watched me
wash them.
I watched you get them wet.

01:52:43.449 --> 01:52:45.928
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.

01:52:46.008 --> 01:52:47.903
Maybe if he had lava,
I could've done
a better job.

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.448
I used the same
fucking soap you did,

01:52:49.528 --> 01:52:52.128
and when I finished,
the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxipad.

01:52:52.167 --> 01:52:53.264
Now, what if he was
to come in here

01:52:53.288 --> 01:52:54.728
and see his towel
like this, Vincent?

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:56.664
It's shit like this that's
going to bring this situation

01:52:56.688 --> 01:52:58.167
to a head, man.

01:52:59.648 --> 01:53:01.328
Look...

01:53:01.408 --> 01:53:03.023
I ain't threatening you
with nothing, all right?

01:53:03.047 --> 01:53:05.007
You know I respect you and all,

01:53:05.087 --> 01:53:07.166
but just don't put me
in this position, all right?

01:53:07.247 --> 01:53:08.287
All right.

01:53:08.367 --> 01:53:10.166
Fine. Fine.

01:53:10.247 --> 01:53:12.926
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

01:53:13.006 --> 01:53:15.687
Just go handle
your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

01:53:17.447 --> 01:53:18.607
Mmm.

01:53:18.687 --> 01:53:20.287
Goddamn, Jimmie.

01:53:20.367 --> 01:53:22.206
This is some serious
gourmet shit.

01:53:22.287 --> 01:53:24.005
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied

01:53:24.085 --> 01:53:26.686
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice, right?

01:53:26.765 --> 01:53:30.366
(LAUGHS) And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

01:53:30.446 --> 01:53:31.526
What flavor is this?

01:53:31.606 --> 01:53:32.965
Knock it off, Julie.

01:53:33.045 --> 01:53:34.646
What?

01:53:34.726 --> 01:53:36.941
I don't need you to tell me
how fucking good
my coffee is, okay?

01:53:36.965 --> 01:53:39.246
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

01:53:39.326 --> 01:53:41.245
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

01:53:41.325 --> 01:53:43.884
I buy the gourmet
expensive stuff
because when I drink it,

01:53:43.964 --> 01:53:45.044
I want to taste it.

01:53:45.124 --> 01:53:46.541
But you know what's
on my mind right now?

01:53:46.565 --> 01:53:48.485
It ain't the coffee
in my kitchen.

01:53:48.565 --> 01:53:50.804
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

01:53:50.884 --> 01:53:52.485
Oh, Jimmie, don't even
worry about it.

01:53:52.565 --> 01:53:53.900
No, no, no,
don't tell me don't think
about anything.

01:53:53.924 --> 01:53:54.940
I want to ask you a question.

01:53:54.964 --> 01:53:56.204
When you came pulling in here,

01:53:56.285 --> 01:53:57.541
did you notice a sign
out in the front of my house

01:53:57.565 --> 01:53:59.163
that said "dead nigger storage"?

01:53:59.244 --> 01:54:00.963
Jimmie, you know
I didn't see no shit...

01:54:01.043 --> 01:54:02.620
Did you notice a sign
in the front of my house

01:54:02.644 --> 01:54:04.444
that said "dead nigger storage"?

01:54:05.203 --> 01:54:07.364
No. I didn't.

01:54:07.444 --> 01:54:08.979
JIMMIE: You know why
you didn't see that sign?

01:54:09.003 --> 01:54:10.244
Why?

01:54:10.324 --> 01:54:11.899
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers

01:54:11.923 --> 01:54:13.923
ain't my fucking business,
that's why!

01:54:14.003 --> 01:54:15.899
Jimmie, we're not going
to store the motherfucker...

01:54:15.923 --> 01:54:17.379
No, no, no. Don't you
fucking realize, man,

01:54:17.403 --> 01:54:18.882
that if Bonnie comes home

01:54:18.962 --> 01:54:20.483
and finds a dead body
in her house,

01:54:20.563 --> 01:54:21.922
I'm going to get divorced?

01:54:22.002 --> 01:54:23.379
All right?
No marriage counselor,
no trial separation.

01:54:23.403 --> 01:54:25.323
I'm going to get
fucking divorced, okay?

01:54:25.403 --> 01:54:28.202
And I don't want
to get fucking divorced.

01:54:28.283 --> 01:54:29.443
Now, man, you know, fuck.

01:54:29.523 --> 01:54:30.922
I mean, I want to help you,

01:54:31.002 --> 01:54:33.042
but I don't want to lose
my wife doing it,
all right?

01:54:33.122 --> 01:54:35.121
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't
going to leave you.

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:36.921
Don't fucking
"Jimmie" me, Jules!

01:54:37.001 --> 01:54:39.161
Okay? Don't fucking
"Jimmie" me.

01:54:39.242 --> 01:54:40.658
There's nothing
that you're going to say

01:54:40.682 --> 01:54:43.082
that's going to make me forget
that I love my wife, is there?

01:54:45.801 --> 01:54:47.081
Look, you know,

01:54:47.161 --> 01:54:50.322
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

01:54:50.402 --> 01:54:52.760
Graveyard shift at the hospital.

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.601
You got to make
some phone calls?

01:54:54.681 --> 01:54:56.601
You got to call some people?

01:54:56.681 --> 01:54:58.880
Well, then do it, and then
get the fuck out of my house

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:00.641
before she gets here.

01:55:00.721 --> 01:55:01.880
That's Kool and the Gang.

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.136
You know, we don't want
to fuck your shit up.

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:04.297
All I want to do
is call my people,

01:55:04.321 --> 01:55:05.920
get them to bring us in,
that's all.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.016
You don't want
to fuck my shit up?

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.840
You're fucking my shit up
right now.

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:11.440
You're going to fuck
my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.240
So just do me
that favor, all right?

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.336
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.999
Well, say she comes home,

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.680
what do you think she'll do?

01:55:21.999 --> 01:55:24.280
Oh, no fucking shit,
she'll freak.

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360
That ain't no kind of answer.

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.038
I mean, you know, I don't.

How much?
A lot or a little?

01:55:29.559 --> 01:55:32.599
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element

01:55:32.679 --> 01:55:34.198

Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.

All I'm doing
is contemplating the "if's."

01:57:37.191 --> 01:57:38.512
JIMMIE:
Uh-huh.

01:57:38.592 --> 01:57:40.991
I was led to believe
if she comes home
and finds us here,

01:57:41.071 --> 01:57:42.751
she wouldn't appreciate it
none too much?

01:57:42.831 --> 01:57:43.951
JIMMIE:
She wouldn't at that.

01:57:43.991 --> 01:57:45.791
All right,
that gives us 40 minutes

01:57:45.871 --> 01:57:47.071
to get the fuck out of Dodge,

01:57:47.151 --> 01:57:48.951
which, if you do what I say
when I say it,

01:57:49.031 --> 01:57:50.190
should be plenty.

01:57:50.271 --> 01:57:52.471
Now, you got a corpse in a car

01:57:52.551 --> 01:57:54.551
minus a head in a garage.
Take me to it.

01:57:58.830 --> 01:58:00.631
(SIGHS)

01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:03.110
Jimmie?

01:58:03.190 --> 01:58:04.311
Uh-huh.

01:58:04.391 --> 01:58:05.711
Do me a favor, will you?

01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:07.006
I thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:08.069
Would you make me a cup?

01:58:08.949 --> 01:58:10.710
Uh, yeah, sure.

01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:14.710
Oh, um, how do you take it?

01:58:14.789 --> 01:58:17.149
Lots of cream, lots of sugar.

01:58:19.909 --> 01:58:21.765
About the car, is there
anything I need to know?

01:58:21.789 --> 01:58:23.805
Does it stall,
does it smoke,
does it make a lot of noise?

01:58:23.829 --> 01:58:25.350
Is there gas in it?
Anything?

01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:27.868
Aside from how it looks,
the car is cool.

01:58:27.948 --> 01:58:29.748
Positive? Don't get me
out there on the road,

01:58:29.828 --> 01:58:31.349
I find out the brake
lights don't work.

01:58:31.429 --> 01:58:32.669
Hey, man, far as I know,

01:58:32.748 --> 01:58:34.309
the motherfucker's tiptop.

01:58:35.028 --> 01:58:36.828
Good enough.

01:58:36.908 --> 01:58:38.589
Let's go back to the kitchen.

01:58:41.709 --> 01:58:44.067
(SIGHS)

01:58:44.147 --> 01:58:45.228
Here you go,
Mr. Wolf.

01:58:45.308 --> 01:58:46.987
Thank you, Jimmie.

01:58:51.867 --> 01:58:53.107
Mmm.

01:58:54.268 --> 01:58:55.827
Okay, first thing,

01:58:55.907 --> 01:58:58.508
you two take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

01:58:58.588 --> 01:58:59.907
Now, Jimmie,

01:58:59.987 --> 01:59:01.523
this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

01:59:01.547 --> 01:59:02.802
That would lead me
to believe that in the garage

01:59:02.826 --> 01:59:03.842
or under the sink,
you got a bunch of cleaners

01:59:03.866 --> 01:59:04.962
and cleansers
and shit like that.

01:59:04.986 --> 01:59:06.082
Yeah, Mr. Wolf.
Under the sink.

01:59:06.106 --> 01:59:07.667
Good. What I need
you two fellas to do

01:59:07.746 --> 01:59:09.066
is take those cleaning products

01:59:09.146 --> 01:59:10.627
and clean the inside of the car.

01:59:10.707 --> 01:59:12.547
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.

01:59:12.627 --> 01:59:13.986
You need to go in the back seat,

01:59:14.066 --> 01:59:17.066
scoop up
all those little pieces
of brain and skull.

01:59:17.146 --> 01:59:18.146
Get it out of there.

01:59:18.227 --> 01:59:19.226
Wipe down the upholstery.

01:59:19.306 --> 01:59:20.362
Now, when it comes
to upholstery,

01:59:20.386 --> 01:59:21.442
It don't need
to be spick-and-span.

01:59:21.466 --> 01:59:22.706
You don't need to eat off it.

01:59:22.785 --> 01:59:24.346
Just give it a good once over.

01:59:24.426 --> 01:59:25.626
What you need to take care of

01:59:25.706 --> 01:59:26.985
are the really messy parts.

01:59:27.065 --> 01:59:28.442
The pools of blood
that have collected,

01:59:28.466 --> 01:59:29.945
you got to soak that shit up.

01:59:30.025 --> 01:59:31.025
Now, Jimmie,

01:59:31.065 --> 01:59:33.306
we need to raid
your linen closet.

01:59:33.386 --> 01:59:34.562
I need blankets.
I need comforters.

01:59:34.586 --> 01:59:36.426
I need quilts.
I need bedspreads.

01:59:36.506 --> 01:59:38.080
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:39.864
No whites.
Can't use 'em.

01:59:39.944 --> 01:59:41.904
We need to camouflage
the interior of the car.

01:59:41.984 --> 01:59:43.201
We're going to line
the front seat

01:59:43.225 --> 01:59:44.984
and the back seat
and the floorboards

01:59:45.064 --> 01:59:46.625
with quilts and blankets.

01:59:46.705 --> 01:59:47.824
So if a cop stops us

01:59:47.904 --> 01:59:49.441
and starts sticking
his big snout in the car,

01:59:49.465 --> 01:59:50.784
the subterfuge won't last,

01:59:50.864 --> 01:59:52.824
but at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.

01:59:53.784 --> 01:59:55.584
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

01:59:56.504 --> 01:59:58.504
"Please" would be nice.

01:59:58.584 --> 01:59:59.584
Come again?

01:59:59.664 --> 02:00:01.584
I said a "please" would be nice.

02:00:03.304 --> 02:00:05.624
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here
to say "please."

02:00:05.704 --> 02:00:07.063
I'm here to tell you what to do.

02:00:08.823 --> 02:00:10.680
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

02:00:10.704 --> 02:00:12.703
you better fucking do it
and do it quick.

02:00:14.062 --> 02:00:15.182
I'm here to help.

02:00:15.263 --> 02:00:16.623
If my help is not appreciated,

02:00:16.703 --> 02:00:17.902
lots of luck, gentlemen.

02:00:17.982 --> 02:00:19.439
No, no, no, Mr. Wolf,
it ain't like that.

02:00:19.463 --> 02:00:20.559
Your help is definitely
appreciated.

02:00:20.583 --> 02:00:22.102
Mr. Wolf, listen.

02:00:22.182 --> 02:00:24.503
I don't mean disrespect, okay?
I respect you.

02:00:24.583 --> 02:00:26.823
I just don't like people
barking orders at me,
that's all.

02:00:26.902 --> 02:00:29.583
If I'm curt with you,
it's because
time is a factor.

02:00:29.663 --> 02:00:31.462
I think fast, I talk fast,

02:00:31.542 --> 02:00:32.782
and I need you guys to act fast

02:00:32.861 --> 02:00:34.542
if you want to get out of this.

02:00:34.622 --> 02:00:36.422
So pretty please
with sugar on top,

02:00:36.502 --> 02:00:37.702
clean the fucking car.

02:00:42.262 --> 02:00:43.982
Don't be looking at me
like that, all right?

02:00:44.021 --> 02:00:45.262
I can feel your look.

02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:50.740
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

02:00:52.661 --> 02:00:54.060
Green.

02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:58.421
Nothing except
for the mess inside.

02:01:01.221 --> 02:01:03.301
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:06.460
Nobody who'll be missed.

02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:10.220
You're a good man, Joe.

02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:11.660
Thanks a bunch.

02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:13.540
How we coming, Jimmie?

02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:15.739
Pretty good.
I got it all here,

02:01:15.819 --> 02:01:17.500
but, uh...
(SIGHS)

02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:18.835
Mr. Wolf, you got to
understand something.

02:01:18.859 --> 02:01:20.819
Winston, Jimmie,
please. Winston.

02:01:20.899 --> 02:01:24.058
Okay. You got
to understand something
now, Winston.

02:01:24.138 --> 02:01:26.259
Uh, no, thank you.

02:01:26.339 --> 02:01:28.898
Uh, this is our best linen here,

02:01:28.978 --> 02:01:31.898
and it's a... it was
a wedding present

02:01:31.978 --> 02:01:34.178
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny,

02:01:34.259 --> 02:01:35.515
and they're not with us anymore.

02:01:35.539 --> 02:01:36.675
And I really want
to help you guys out...

02:01:36.699 --> 02:01:38.138
Let me ask you
a question, Jimmie,

02:01:39.098 --> 02:01:40.219
if you don't mind.

02:01:40.299 --> 02:01:41.578
No, no, please,
please, go ahead.

02:01:43.418 --> 02:01:46.298
Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Ginny,

02:01:46.378 --> 02:01:47.737
were they millionaires?

02:01:48.897 --> 02:01:50.458
No.

02:01:50.538 --> 02:01:53.258
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is,

02:01:53.338 --> 02:01:56.338
and I'm positive
if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

02:01:56.418 --> 02:01:57.418
Ginny.

02:01:57.458 --> 02:01:59.297
Ginny were here,

02:01:59.377 --> 02:02:03.217
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

02:02:03.297 --> 02:02:05.657
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

02:02:10.096 --> 02:02:11.537
I like oak myself.

02:02:11.617 --> 02:02:13.936
That's what I have
in my bedroom.

02:02:14.976 --> 02:02:16.337
How about you, Jimmie?

02:02:18.095 --> 02:02:19.616
You an oak man?

02:02:20.935 --> 02:02:22.095
Oak's nice.

02:02:28.456 --> 02:02:29.975
Oh, man.

02:02:30.055 --> 02:02:32.095
I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

02:02:32.175 --> 02:02:34.256
This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit.

02:02:34.336 --> 02:02:35.894
Jules, did you ever hear
the philosophy

02:02:35.974 --> 02:02:37.431
that once a man admits
that he is wrong

02:02:37.455 --> 02:02:39.854
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

02:02:39.934 --> 02:02:40.934
Have you ever heard that?

02:02:41.014 --> 02:02:42.734
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit.

02:02:42.814 --> 02:02:44.054
The motherfucker said that shit

02:02:44.134 --> 02:02:45.591
never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull

02:02:45.615 --> 02:02:46.974
on account of your dumb ass.

02:02:47.054 --> 02:02:48.255
I got a threshold, Jules.

02:02:48.335 --> 02:02:50.255
I got a threshold for
the abuse that I will take.

02:02:50.335 --> 02:02:52.150
Now, right now,
I'm a fucking
race car, all right?

02:02:52.174 --> 02:02:53.694
And you got me in the red.

02:02:53.773 --> 02:02:55.869
And I'm just saying...
I'm just saying
that it's fucking dangerous

02:02:55.893 --> 02:02:57.893
to have a race car in
the fucking red, that's all.

02:02:57.973 --> 02:02:58.973
I could blow.

02:02:59.053 --> 02:03:00.093
Oh, oh, you ready to blow?

02:03:00.173 --> 02:03:01.334
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

02:03:01.414 --> 02:03:03.069
Well, I'm a mushroom cloud
laying motherfucker,

02:03:03.093 --> 02:03:04.093
motherfucker.

02:03:04.173 --> 02:03:05.493
Every time my fingers
touch brain,

02:03:05.534 --> 02:03:08.614
I'm Super Fly T.N.T.
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

02:03:08.694 --> 02:03:11.012
In fact, what the fuck
am I doing in the back?

02:03:11.092 --> 02:03:13.132
You the motherfucker who
should be on brain detail.

02:03:13.213 --> 02:03:15.052
We fucking switching.
I'm washing the windows,

02:03:15.132 --> 02:03:16.892
and you picking up
this nigger's skull.

02:03:26.653 --> 02:03:28.372
Fine job, gentlemen.

02:03:29.492 --> 02:03:31.412
We may get out of this yet.

02:03:31.492 --> 02:03:33.811
I can't believe
this is the same car.

02:03:33.891 --> 02:03:37.252
Well, let's not start
sucking each other's
dicks quite yet.

02:03:37.332 --> 02:03:39.212
Phase one is complete,
clean the car,

02:03:39.292 --> 02:03:40.787
which moves us right
along to phase two.

02:03:40.811 --> 02:03:42.292
Clean you two.

02:03:44.971 --> 02:03:46.090
Strip.

02:03:46.170 --> 02:03:47.571
All the way?

02:03:47.651 --> 02:03:48.970
WOLF:
To your bare ass.

02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:51.371
Quickly, gentlemen.

02:03:52.090 --> 02:03:53.611
We got about 15 minutes

02:03:53.691 --> 02:03:56.011
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling
into the driveway.

02:03:56.050 --> 02:03:58.331
Damn. This morning air
is some chilly shit.

02:03:58.411 --> 02:04:00.051
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

02:04:00.130 --> 02:04:01.451
You know what you two look like?

02:04:01.531 --> 02:04:02.970
VINCENT:
What?

02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:05.209
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off
somebody's head.

02:04:06.210 --> 02:04:07.450
Stripping off those bloody rags

02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:09.129
is absolutely necessary.

02:04:13.290 --> 02:04:14.969
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.

02:04:15.049 --> 02:04:17.450
Don't do nothing stupid,
like leaving this shit
out front

02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:19.929
for Otto the Garbageman
to pick up,
you know what I'm saying?

02:04:20.009 --> 02:04:21.888
Don't worry.
We're taking it with us.

02:04:21.968 --> 02:04:23.728
Jim, the soap.

02:04:25.289 --> 02:04:26.409
Vincent.

02:04:26.489 --> 02:04:27.609
WOLF:
Okay, gentlemen,

02:04:27.689 --> 02:04:29.808
you've both been to
county before I'm sure.

02:04:29.888 --> 02:04:30.888
Here it comes.

02:04:30.968 --> 02:04:32.848
Goddamn! The water's
fucking cold.

02:04:32.928 --> 02:04:34.968
WOLF: Better you
than me, gentlemen.

02:04:35.048 --> 02:04:37.249
(CHUCKLES)

02:04:37.329 --> 02:04:38.489
Don't be afraid of the soap.

02:04:38.569 --> 02:04:39.967
Spread it around.

02:04:40.047 --> 02:04:41.103
Get him up there a little bit.

02:04:41.127 --> 02:04:42.288
Vincent's hair.

02:04:42.368 --> 02:04:44.248 line:20%
...my hair.
Come on, do it,
god damn it! Do it!

02:04:44.328 --> 02:04:46.328
Uh, uh...

02:04:46.408 --> 02:04:47.608
Towel 'em.

02:04:58.766 --> 02:05:00.726
WOLF: They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

02:05:01.687 --> 02:05:03.367
(WOLF LAUGHS)

02:05:03.447 --> 02:05:04.647
Perfect.

02:05:04.726 --> 02:05:06.806
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

02:05:08.207 --> 02:05:10.367
You guys look like...

02:05:10.447 --> 02:05:12.287
What do they look like, Jimmie?

02:05:12.367 --> 02:05:13.367
Dorks.

02:05:13.407 --> 02:05:14.407
(LAUGHS)

02:05:14.447 --> 02:05:16.045
They look like
a couple of dorks.

02:05:16.125 --> 02:05:17.286
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:05:17.366 --> 02:05:19.165
Ha-ha-ha. They're
your clothes, motherfucker.

02:05:19.246 --> 02:05:20.286
Come on, gentlemen.

02:05:20.366 --> 02:05:21.821
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

02:05:21.845 --> 02:05:23.765
Don't make me beg.

02:05:26.725 --> 02:05:28.085
Okay, gentlemen,

02:05:28.165 --> 02:05:29.965
let's get our rules
of the road straight.

02:05:30.045 --> 02:05:33.004
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's
Truck and Tow.

02:05:33.084 --> 02:05:35.205
Now, Monster Joe
and his daughter Raquel

02:05:35.285 --> 02:05:36.501
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

02:05:36.525 --> 02:05:38.525
The place is North Hollywood,

02:05:38.605 --> 02:05:40.124
so a few twists and turns aside,

02:05:40.205 --> 02:05:42.004
we'll be going up Hollywood Way.

02:05:42.084 --> 02:05:44.565
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.

02:05:44.645 --> 02:05:46.764
Jules, you ride with me.

02:05:46.844 --> 02:05:48.724
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

02:05:48.804 --> 02:05:52.524
Now, if we come across
the path of any John Q. Laws,

02:05:52.604 --> 02:05:54.380
nobody does a fucking thing
until I do something.

02:05:54.404 --> 02:05:55.564
Right.
What did I say?

02:05:56.843 --> 02:05:58.204
Don't do shit unless...

02:05:58.284 --> 02:05:59.763
Unless what?

02:05:59.843 --> 02:06:00.883
Unless you do it first.

02:06:00.963 --> 02:06:02.324
Spoken like a true prodigy.

02:06:03.163 --> 02:06:04.444
How about you, Lash La Rue?

02:06:04.524 --> 02:06:06.524
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

02:06:06.564 --> 02:06:07.844
Mr. Wolf, look,
the gun went off.

02:06:07.923 --> 02:06:09.002
I don't why.

02:06:09.082 --> 02:06:10.363
I'm cool.
I promise you.

02:06:10.443 --> 02:06:12.563
Fair enough. Now,
I drive real fucking fast,

02:06:12.643 --> 02:06:13.802
so keep up.

02:06:13.882 --> 02:06:16.122
If I get my car back
any different than I gave it,

02:06:16.203 --> 02:06:18.683
Monster Joe's going
to be disposing of two bodies.

02:06:18.762 --> 02:06:20.563
(METAL CLATTERS)

02:06:21.403 --> 02:06:23.042
Out of my way, Rex.

02:06:25.403 --> 02:06:26.761
We cool?

02:06:26.841 --> 02:06:27.881
Like it never happened.

02:06:28.682 --> 02:06:29.682
VINCENT:
All right.

02:06:29.721 --> 02:06:31.602
Boys, this is Raquel.

02:06:31.682 --> 02:06:34.161
Someday, all this will be hers.

02:06:34.242 --> 02:06:36.801
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

02:06:36.881 --> 02:06:39.242
You guys going
to a volleyball game
or something?

02:06:39.322 --> 02:06:40.322
(WOLF LAUGHS)

02:06:41.442 --> 02:06:43.161
I'm taking my lady
out for breakfast.

02:06:43.242 --> 02:06:45.321
Maybe I could
drop you two off.
Where do you live?

02:06:45.401 --> 02:06:46.840
Redondo.
Inglewood.

02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:49.241
It's... it's your future.

02:06:49.321 --> 02:06:52.840
I... I see a... a cab ride.

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:54.760
Move out of the sticks, fellas.

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:56.120
Say good night, Raquel.

02:06:56.201 --> 02:06:57.321
Good night, Raquel.

02:06:57.401 --> 02:06:58.601
I'll see you guys around.

02:06:58.681 --> 02:07:00.361
Stay out of trouble,
you crazy kids.

02:07:00.441 --> 02:07:02.280
Mr. Wolf, I just want
to tell you

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:04.200
it was a real pleasure
watching you work.

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:06.360
Yeah, really, and thank you
very much, Mr. Wolf.

02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:09.839
Call me Winston.

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:12.999
WOLF: You see that,
young lady? Respect.

02:07:13.079 --> 02:07:14.079
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)

02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:16.759
Respect for one's elders
shows character.

02:07:16.839 --> 02:07:18.360
I have character.

02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.199
Because you are a character

02:07:20.279 --> 02:07:21.918
doesn't mean that
you have character.

02:07:27.199 --> 02:07:28.239
(TIRES SQUEAL)

02:07:29.599 --> 02:07:31.399
Want to share a cab?

02:07:31.479 --> 02:07:33.038
I could go for some breakfast.

02:07:33.118 --> 02:07:34.479
Feel like having
breakfast with me?

02:07:34.559 --> 02:07:35.838
(DIALS PHONE)
Cool.

02:07:41.957 --> 02:07:43.133
I don't know why, I just thought

02:07:43.157 --> 02:07:44.654
he'd be European
or something, because he...

02:07:44.678 --> 02:07:47.117
Yo, man, he's about as
European as English Bob.

02:07:47.198 --> 02:07:48.318
I know that now, but...

02:07:48.398 --> 02:07:49.478
Was he cool or what?

02:07:49.558 --> 02:07:50.598
Thank you.

02:07:50.678 --> 02:07:52.957
Totally fucking cool,
in control.

02:07:53.037 --> 02:07:54.757
Didn't even, you know,
really get pissed

02:07:54.837 --> 02:07:56.052
when you were fucking with him.

02:07:56.076 --> 02:07:57.437
I was amazed.

02:07:57.517 --> 02:07:58.597
(LAUGHS)

02:07:58.677 --> 02:07:59.756
Want some bacon?

02:07:59.836 --> 02:08:01.517
No, man.
I don't eat pork.

02:08:01.597 --> 02:08:02.677
Are you Jewish?

02:08:02.756 --> 02:08:03.756
Naw, I ain't Jewish.

02:08:03.836 --> 02:08:05.052
I just don't dig
on swine, that's all.

02:08:05.076 --> 02:08:06.517
Why not?

02:08:06.597 --> 02:08:09.277
Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.

02:08:09.357 --> 02:08:10.836
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.

02:08:11.557 --> 02:08:12.955
Pork chops taste good.

02:08:13.035 --> 02:08:14.875
Hey, a sewer rat
may taste like pumpkin pie,

02:08:14.955 --> 02:08:17.755
but I'd never know
because I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

02:08:18.755 --> 02:08:20.516
Pigs sleep and root in shit.

02:08:20.596 --> 02:08:22.476
That's a filthy animal.

02:08:22.556 --> 02:08:25.091
I ain't eating nothing
that ain't got sense enough
to disregard its own feces.

02:08:25.115 --> 02:08:27.676
How about a dog?
A dog eats his own feces.

02:08:27.755 --> 02:08:29.795
I don't eat dog, either.

02:08:29.875 --> 02:08:33.154
Yeah, but do you
consider a dog
to be a filthy animal?

02:08:33.235 --> 02:08:35.154
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

02:08:35.235 --> 02:08:37.074
but they're definitely dirty.

02:08:37.154 --> 02:08:39.074
But a dog's got personality.

02:08:39.154 --> 02:08:40.555
Personality goes a long way.

02:08:40.635 --> 02:08:42.154
Ah, so by that rationale,

02:08:42.235 --> 02:08:43.675
if a pig had
a better personality,

02:08:43.754 --> 02:08:45.315
he would cease to be
a filthy animal.

02:08:45.395 --> 02:08:46.395
Is that true?

02:08:46.475 --> 02:08:47.571
Well, we'd have
to be talking about

02:08:47.595 --> 02:08:49.073
one charming motherfucking pig.

02:08:49.153 --> 02:08:50.234
(LAUGHS)

02:08:50.314 --> 02:08:51.929
I mean, he'd have to be
10 times more charming

02:08:51.953 --> 02:08:53.170
than that Arnold
on<i> Green Acres,</i>
you know what I'm saying?

02:08:53.194 --> 02:08:54.274
(LAUGHS)

02:08:54.354 --> 02:08:55.993
(LAUGHS)

02:08:58.153 --> 02:09:00.474
Oh, man, that's good.

02:09:00.554 --> 02:09:03.113
That's good, man.
You're starting to lighten up.

02:09:04.354 --> 02:09:06.593
You been sitting there
all serious and shit.

02:09:06.673 --> 02:09:08.169
Man, I've just been
sitting here thinking.

02:09:08.193 --> 02:09:09.513
About what?

02:09:09.593 --> 02:09:10.833
About the miracle we witnessed.

02:09:10.912 --> 02:09:12.433
The miracle <i>you</i> witnessed.

02:09:12.513 --> 02:09:14.072
I witnessed a freak occurrence.

02:09:14.152 --> 02:09:15.393
What is a miracle, Vincent?

02:09:17.553 --> 02:09:18.673
An act of God.

02:09:18.752 --> 02:09:20.513
And what's an act of God?

02:09:23.991 --> 02:09:25.512
When, um...

02:09:25.592 --> 02:09:27.272
God makes the impossible
possible.

02:09:28.312 --> 02:09:32.232
But this morning
I don't think qualifies.

02:09:32.312 --> 02:09:34.951
Hey, Vincent, don't you see
that shit don't matter?

02:09:35.031 --> 02:09:37.031
You're judging this shit
the wrong way.

02:09:37.111 --> 02:09:38.991
I mean, it could be
God stopped the bullets,

02:09:39.071 --> 02:09:40.432
or he changed Coke to Pepsi,

02:09:40.512 --> 02:09:41.830
he found my fucking car keys.

02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:44.311
You don't judge
shit like this
based on merit.

02:09:44.391 --> 02:09:46.110
Now, whether or not
what we experienced

02:09:46.191 --> 02:09:48.511
was an "according
to Hoyle" miracle

02:09:48.591 --> 02:09:49.790
Is insignificant.

02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:51.710
But what is significant

02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:54.070
Is I felt the touch of God.

02:09:54.150 --> 02:09:55.311
God got involved.

02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:57.070
But why?

02:09:57.150 --> 02:09:58.950
Well, that's what's
fucking with me.

02:09:59.030 --> 02:10:00.069
I don't know why,

02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:01.310
But I can't go back to sleep.

02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:03.550
You're serious?

02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:04.965
You're really thinking
about quitting?

02:10:04.989 --> 02:10:06.510
The life?
Yeah.

02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:07.590
Most definitely.

02:10:07.670 --> 02:10:09.390
Fuck.

02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:10.709
What you going to do, then?

02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:13.430 line:20%
Well...

02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:16.149 line:20%
That's what I've been
sitting here contemplating.

02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:19.788 line:20%
First, I'm going to deliver
this case to Marsellus.

02:10:19.868 --> 02:10:22.669
Then, basically, I'm just
going to walk the Earth.

02:10:22.748 --> 02:10:24.028 line:20%
What you mean, "walk the Earth"?

02:10:24.108 --> 02:10:26.309 line:20%
You know, like Caine in<i> Kung Fu.</i>

02:10:26.389 --> 02:10:27.549 line:20%
Walk from place to place,

02:10:27.629 --> 02:10:28.988 line:20%
meet people, get in adventures.

02:10:29.068 --> 02:10:31.229 line:20%
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

02:10:31.309 --> 02:10:33.309 line:20%
Until God puts me
where he wants me to be.

02:10:33.389 --> 02:10:34.549 line:20%
And what if he don't do that?

02:10:34.589 --> 02:10:36.787 line:20%
If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.

02:10:37.707 --> 02:10:39.308 line:20%
So you decided to be a bum?

02:10:39.388 --> 02:10:41.228 line:20%
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.

02:10:41.308 --> 02:10:42.827 line:20%
No more, no less.

02:10:42.907 --> 02:10:44.747 line:20%
No, Jules.
You decided to be a bum.

02:10:44.827 --> 02:10:46.907 line:20%

When you were sitting there

Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

02:16:42.928 --> 02:16:45.008
We're all gonna be like

02:16:47.607 --> 02:16:49.366
Come on, Yolanda,
what's Fonzie like?

He's cool?

02:16:50.487 --> 02:16:51.526
What?
Cool.

And that's what
we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.

Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

02:17:01.526 --> 02:17:03.046
And when I count three,

02:17:03.126 --> 02:17:05.407
I want you to let go
of your gun,

02:17:05.487 --> 02:17:07.086
put your palms
flat on the table,

02:17:07.885 --> 02:17:10.646
and sit your ass down.

02:17:10.725 --> 02:17:13.605
But when you do it,
you do it cool.

02:17:14.725 --> 02:17:16.086
You ready?

02:17:17.006 --> 02:17:18.926

Okay, now you let him go!

02:17:31.964 --> 02:17:34.204
Yolanda, I thought
you were gonna be cool.

02:17:34.284 --> 02:17:36.165
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

02:17:36.245 --> 02:17:38.284
And when I get nervous,
I get scared.

02:17:38.364 --> 02:17:40.124
And when motherfuckers
get scared,

02:17:40.204 --> 02:17:42.723
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

02:17:43.924 --> 02:17:46.924
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

02:17:48.283 --> 02:17:50.644
Well, that seems
to be the situation.

02:17:50.723 --> 02:17:54.324
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that,

02:17:54.404 --> 02:17:57.043
and Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

02:17:57.123 --> 02:17:58.844
So let's see what we can do.

02:18:00.442 --> 02:18:01.962
Now...

02:18:02.042 --> 02:18:03.643
Here's the situation.

02:18:05.202 --> 02:18:08.003
Normally both your asses
would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken,

02:18:08.083 --> 02:18:09.602
but you happened
to pull this shit

02:18:09.683 --> 02:18:10.979
while I'm in
a transitional period,

02:18:11.003 --> 02:18:12.163
and I don't want to kill you.

02:18:12.202 --> 02:18:13.683
I want to help you.

02:18:13.763 --> 02:18:15.923
But I can't give you this case,

02:18:16.003 --> 02:18:18.082
'cause it don't belong to me.

02:18:18.162 --> 02:18:20.482
Besides, I been through
too much shit

02:18:20.562 --> 02:18:21.642
over this case this morning

02:18:21.721 --> 02:18:23.201
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

02:18:24.322 --> 02:18:25.801
Vincent!
(YELPS)

02:18:25.881 --> 02:18:27.482
Be cool!

02:18:27.562 --> 02:18:30.721
Yolanda, it's cool, baby!
It's cool!

02:18:30.801 --> 02:18:31.881
We still just talking!

02:18:31.961 --> 02:18:33.322
Come on, point the gun at me!

02:18:33.402 --> 02:18:35.360
Point the gun at me!
There you go.

02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:38.440
Now, Vincent, you just hang back

02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:39.657
and don't do a goddamn thing.

02:18:39.681 --> 02:18:40.960
Tell her we're still cool.

02:18:42.321 --> 02:18:43.521
We're still cool, Honey Bunny.

02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:45.440
How we doing, baby?

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:47.360
I... I gotta go pee.

02:18:48.321 --> 02:18:49.520
I want to go home.

02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:50.761
Just hang in there, baby.

02:18:50.841 --> 02:18:52.016
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:53.240
And Ringo's proud of you.

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:54.920
It's almost over.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.160
Tell her you're proud of her.

02:18:56.879 --> 02:18:57.976
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.719
I love you.

02:18:59.799 --> 02:19:01.359
I love you, too, Honey Bunny.

02:19:01.439 --> 02:19:04.560
Now, I want you
to go in that bag

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:06.519
and find my wallet.

02:19:09.359 --> 02:19:10.400
Which one is it?

02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:12.319
It's the one that says,
"bad motherfucker."

02:19:26.999 --> 02:19:27.999
That's it.

02:19:28.038 --> 02:19:29.597
That's my bad motherfucker.

02:19:29.678 --> 02:19:32.037
Open it up.
Take out the money.

02:19:37.758 --> 02:19:38.957
Count it.

02:19:45.238 --> 02:19:46.398
How much is there?

02:19:50.116 --> 02:19:51.196
About $1,500.

02:19:51.276 --> 02:19:53.237
Okay, put it in your
pocket. It's yours.

02:19:54.837 --> 02:19:57.436
Now, with the rest of those
wallets and the register,

02:19:57.516 --> 02:19:59.477
that makes this a pretty
successful little score.

02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:01.757
Jules, you give
that fuckin' nimrod $1,500,

02:20:01.837 --> 02:20:03.133
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

02:20:03.157 --> 02:20:04.276
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!

02:20:04.355 --> 02:20:06.235
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckin' thing.

02:20:06.275 --> 02:20:07.955
Vince, shut the fuck up!

02:20:08.836 --> 02:20:09.875
Shut up!

02:20:09.955 --> 02:20:11.715
Come on, Yolanda,
stay with me, baby.

02:20:12.996 --> 02:20:14.516
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

02:20:15.595 --> 02:20:17.236
I'm buyin' somethin'
for my money.

02:20:18.595 --> 02:20:19.996
Wanna know what
I'm buyin', Ringo?

02:20:20.795 --> 02:20:21.996
What?

02:20:22.076 --> 02:20:23.194
Your life.

02:20:23.274 --> 02:20:24.274
I'm givin' you that money

02:20:24.354 --> 02:20:26.194
so I don't have
to kill your ass.

02:20:27.635 --> 02:20:28.755
You read the Bible, Ringo?

02:20:30.114 --> 02:20:31.755
Not regularly, no.

02:20:31.835 --> 02:20:34.475
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

02:20:34.555 --> 02:20:36.434
Ezekiel 25:17.

02:20:38.034 --> 02:20:39.514
"The path of the righteous man

02:20:39.594 --> 02:20:40.873
"is beset on all sides

02:20:40.953 --> 02:20:42.593
"by the inequities
of the selfish

02:20:42.674 --> 02:20:44.154
"and the tyranny of evil men.

02:20:44.953 --> 02:20:46.033
"Blessed is he

02:20:46.113 --> 02:20:48.033
"who in the name of
charity and good will

02:20:48.113 --> 02:20:50.009
"shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness,

02:20:50.033 --> 02:20:51.554
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper

02:20:51.634 --> 02:20:54.154
"and the finder
of lost children.

02:20:54.234 --> 02:20:55.994
"And I will strike down
upon thee

02:20:56.074 --> 02:20:58.313
"with great vengeance
and furious anger

02:20:58.393 --> 02:21:01.792
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

02:21:01.872 --> 02:21:04.153
"And you will know I am the lord

02:21:04.233 --> 02:21:06.272
"when I lay
my vengeance upon you."

02:21:08.712 --> 02:21:10.913
Now, I been sayin'
that shit for years.

02:21:10.993 --> 02:21:13.592
And if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

02:21:15.073 --> 02:21:16.912
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

02:21:16.992 --> 02:21:18.712
I just thought it was
some cold-blooded shit

02:21:18.752 --> 02:21:19.752
to say to a motherfucker

02:21:19.832 --> 02:21:21.312
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

02:21:22.271 --> 02:21:23.528
But I saw some shit this mornin'

02:21:23.552 --> 02:21:24.552
made me think twice.

02:21:25.591 --> 02:21:27.552
See, now I'm thinkin'...

02:21:27.632 --> 02:21:31.191
maybe it means
you're the evil man

02:21:31.271 --> 02:21:33.311
and I'm the righteous man,

02:21:33.391 --> 02:21:35.110
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,

02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:37.391
he's the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass

02:21:37.471 --> 02:21:38.831
in the valley of darkness.

02:21:39.671 --> 02:21:41.671
Or it could mean

02:21:41.751 --> 02:21:45.190 line:20%
you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd,

02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:47.950 line:20%
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

02:21:48.751 --> 02:21:50.071 line:20%
Now, I'd like that.

02:21:51.109 --> 02:21:52.550 line:20%
But that shit ain't the truth.

02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:55.509 line:20%
The truth is...

02:21:57.189 --> 02:21:58.910 line:20%
You're the weak...

02:22:00.029 --> 02:22:02.349 line:20%
and I am the tyranny
of evil men.

02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:06.189 line:20%
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:11.588 line:20%
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

02:22:27.427 --> 02:22:29.107 line:20%
Go on.

02:22:44.907 --> 02:22:46.627
(SIGHS)

02:22:46.706 --> 02:22:49.147
I think we should
be leaving now.

02:22:49.227 --> 02:22:50.706
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.
